# CPU Implementation
## Overview 
This project involved the design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC CPU based on the MIPS architecture using VHDL. The project was divided into four key phases:

### ALU Design – 
Implemented a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of addition, subtraction, and logical operations.
### Register File Design – 
Developed a multi-port register file with synchronous writes and asynchronous reads.
### Next-Address Unit – 
Designed logic for handling program counter updates, including branch and jump instructions.
### Full CPU Implementation – 
Integrated all components to form a functional CPU with instruction and data caches.

## Technologies & Tools
VHDL for hardware description
ModelSim for simulation
Xilinx Vivado for synthesis and FPGA implementation

## Results
Verified design functionality through waveform analysis and testbenches.
Successfully synthesized the CPU on an FPGA.
Gained hands-on experience with CPU design, digital logic, and hardware debugging.

# CPU Implementation
## Overview 
This project involved the design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC CPU based on the MIPS architecture using VHDL. The project was divided into four key phases:

### ALU Design – <span>Implemented a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit capable of addition, subtraction, and logical operations.</span>
### Register File Design – <span>Developed a multi-port register file with synchronous writes and asynchronous reads.</span>
### Next-Address Unit – <span>Designed logic for handling program counter updates, including branch and jump instructions.</span>
### Full CPU Implementation – <span>Integrated all components to form a functional CPU with instruction and data caches.</span>

## Technologies & Tools
VHDL for hardware description
ModelSim for simulation
Xilinx Vivado for synthesis and FPGA implementation

## Results
Verified design functionality through waveform analysis and testbenches.
Successfully synthesized the CPU on an FPGA.
Gained hands-on experience with CPU design, digital logic, and hardware debugging.
